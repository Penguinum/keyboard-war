## Keyboard-war
Bullet hell game with kaomoji-based characters. Early pre-pre-alpha stage. Game's name is to be changed.

Most of the code is written in Moonscript. I won't compile the code to Lua before it gets to release, so LPeg library is **required** to run the game. Moonscript is not required, though (because I have it in a single file: see moonyscript.lua).

If you want to use Moonscript with Love2d without too much problems (i.e. wrong error line numbers and need for compile step), you can have a look at this repo. You need 2 things:
* Use Moonscript loader to be able to require \*.moon files (see main.lua)
* Provide custom love.errhand function to rewrite error messages (see main.lua and util/errhand.lua)
